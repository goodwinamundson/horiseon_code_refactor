# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description
The purpose of this project was to take the existing code from the Horiseon Social Solutions website and refactor it to be better accessible for people using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
Making websites more accessible not only helps the host reach a wider audience but can also help companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

The primary goals of this project are:


WHEN I view the source code

THEN I find semantic HTML elements


WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning


WHEN I view the image elements

THEN I find accessible alt attributes


WHEN I view the heading attributes

THEN they fall in sequential order


WHEN I view the title element

THEN I find a concise, descriptive title


This project shows how important proper html syntax and structure are for meeting accesibility standards. In the future a more concise README.md file may be beneficial. 

## Usage
The project, hosted at 

https://github.com/goodwinamundson/horiseon_code_refactor 

can be accessed with the link: 

https://goodwinamundson.github.io/horiseon_code_refactor/Develop/index.html 

Visiting the second link should bring you to the functional website for Horiseon Social Solutions.  All links at the top of the webpage will bring the user to the corresponding section of the page.  As seen in the index.html and styles.css files the code should meet basic requirements for accessiblility standards. 

### Functional website should appear as in following screenshots: #
