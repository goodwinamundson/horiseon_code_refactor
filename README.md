# Horiseon Code Refactor

## Description
The purpose of this project was to take the existing code from the Horiseon Social Solutions website and refactor it to be better accessible for people using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 
Making websites more accessible not only helps the host reach a wider audience but can also help companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

The primary goals of this project are:
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

This project shows how important proper html syntax and structure are for meeting accesibility standards. 

## Usage
The project, hosted at https://github.com/goodwinamundson/horiseon_code_refactor can be accessed with the link: https://goodwinamundson.github.io/horiseon_code_refactor/Develop/index.html 
Visiting the second link should bring you to the function website for Horiseon Social Solutions.  All links at the top of the page will bring the user to the corresponding section of the page.  As seen in the index.html and styles.css files the code should meet basic requirements for accessiblility standars.

Correct HTML 
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
